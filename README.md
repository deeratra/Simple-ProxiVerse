# ProxiVerse  

ProxiVerse is a lightweight 2D virtual space where users can interact in a shared environment. Designed to mimic simple metaverse interactions, it enables users to log in, join rooms, create elements, and engage in proximity-based video calls.
This project was created as a learning exercise to explore concepts in WebRTC, WebSockets, and full-stack development.
It is not production-ready and is intended purely for learning purposes.
